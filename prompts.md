## Prompt 1
Hey there! I've got this exciting idea to create a cake raffle web app. I'm considering using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for this.


I envision a form where users can enter their names to participate. Once we have all the participants, there should be a 'Draw' button that, when clicked, picks a random winner from the pool.


Please outline the basic steps to get started.

## Prompt 2
Wonderful! Please generate the project code for steps 1-3 of your outline.


Divide the interface into different sections: a header, a container holding an entry form, a participants list, a winner display area, and a "Draw" button.


Clicking the "draw" button should display the winner's name with a cake and party emoji. Use a vibrant color scheme such as `#ff4081` for the header background color and complementary colors for the button states.


I want you to make the CSS and JavaScript code easy to understand, even for non-coders. Remember to add code comments above each CSS rule and each line of JavaScript.

  Challenge: Reset button
   * Add a "Reset" button that clears the participant list and winner display.
   * The button should allow users to start a new round of the cake raffle. 
     HINT: set the number of items in the participants array (its length) equal to 0.
   * Use this color value for the button background #007bff
     and this color for its :hover state #1367c0.

"I want to add a 'Reset' button to my Cake Raffle web app. Please update my current HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the following requirements:

HTML: Add a 'Reset' button inside the draw-area section, next to the 'Draw' button.

CSS: Style the Reset button with a background color of #007bff. Add a :hover state with a background color of #1367c0. Ensure it matches the sizing and font style of the other buttons.

JavaScript: Write a function for the Reset button that:

Sets the participants array length to 0 to clear the data.

Clears the list of names from the participantList on the screen.

Clears any text inside the winnerDisplay area.

Please provide the updated code blocks with comments explaining how the reset logic works."
